<p>Welcome to my fork of the Neovim-from-scratch repository, originally created and maintained by Christian Chiarulli. This repository is a tribute to his great work, and I would like to give him special recognition for his contributions to the Neovim community.</p>

<p>When I first came across LunarVim, I was impressed with its comprehensive configuration and how it simplified the process of setting up Neovim. Through Christian's work, I learned about Neovim, the Lua programming language, and how to create a configuration that is understandable and easy to work with.</p>

<p>Since forking the repository, I have added more functionalities, modularized the code, and migrated the plugin manager from Packer to Lazy. Additionally, I am working on improving the user interface to make it look and function more like an IDE. With these changes, I hope to provide an even better development experience for myself and other users.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope that my contributions will help you in your development journey. If you want to see the full project, you can access <a href="https://github.com/sebastiandevops/chilivim">here</a>.</p>
